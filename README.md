# Kanye Voice Generative AI

This repository contains a Python notebook that uses generative AI to replace the voice in any vocal audio file with Kanye West's voice. The notebook uses pre-trained deep learning models and libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, and Librosa to perform audio processing and generation.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow 2.0 or later
- NumPy
- Librosa
- FFmpeg (optional)

Note that FFmpeg is only required if you want to convert your output audio file to a different format.

## Usage
To use the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and follow the instructions provided. You will need to provide an input vocal audio file, as well as a reference Kanye West audio file that the generative AI will use to model Kanye's voice.

The notebook will then use generative AI to analyze the reference Kanye West audio file and create a voice model that can be used to replace the voice in your input vocal audio file. The output will be a new audio file with the original instrumentation and background music, but with Kanye West's voice singing the vocals.

## Caveats
It's important to note that the generative AI used in this notebook is not perfect, and the resulting output may not sound exactly like Kanye West's voice. Additionally, the output may contain artifacts or errors due to limitations in the technology and the training data used to create the models.
